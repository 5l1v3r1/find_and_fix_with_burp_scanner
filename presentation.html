# Find and Fix Your Web Security Vulnerabilities With Burp Scanner

Lee Johnson (LEEJO / leejo / lee@humanstate.com)

## Should you scan your app for vulnerabilities?

--

* Is it public facing: Yes

--

* Is it internal only: Yes

--

* Is it a single use private app only accessible by you: Why not?

???

---

## How often should you scan?

* Anyone here who has a public facing app that has never been scanned?

???
If so, first thing you do when you get back is set this up!

--

* We get scanned externally once a year

* And self scan at least twice a year

--

* Also scan on any major refactoring or major feature additions

--

* Automating this would be the end goal

???
Haven't got around to doing this yet, and perhaps not so much value as comprehensive scans take a long time (hours)

---

## OWASP (Open Web App Security Project) Top Ten 2017

???

OWASP Top Ten was updated last year (2017), which was the first update in four years

--

* Injection

--

* Broken Authentication

???

Permitting weak passwords, allowing brute force attacks, not hashing + salting passwords, not invalidating sessions, etc

--

* Sensitive Data Exposure

???

Not using HTTPS, using  weak cryptographic algorithms

--

* XML External Entities (XXE)

???

Not sanitising external references (we might see this in JSON-Schema soon?). Typical DOS attack example below

--

```
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///dev/random" >]>
```

--

* Broken Access Control

???

User manipulates URLs to get access: primary keys in URL, JWTs, etc

--

* Security Misconfiguration

???

Unnecessary ports open, OOTB default accounts enabled, deps not up to date or patched, etc

--

* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

--

* Insecure Deserialization

--

* Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

--

* Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

???

Not knowing you've been hacked - audit failed logins, checks warnings, etc

That's the ten most serious from about one hundred types of attack.

---

## Finding Vulnerabilities with Burp Scanner

* Burp Suite is a commercial closed sourced product

* Costs about â‚¬300 per single licence

--

* Comprehensive and configurable

* Updated frequently

--

* Industry "standard"

???
When we've been externally scanned it's the one they use

--

* I have no affiliation with them, I just think it's a good product

--

* Open source alternatives are available, more on those later

---

#### [OWASP ZAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) (Zed Attack Proxy Project)

???

Java

Seems very easy to use, not as configurable as Burp?

Trivial to install and run.

---

#### [w3af](http://w3af.org/)

Example script:

```
plugins
output console,text_file
output
output config text_file
set output_file output-w3af.txt
set verbose True
back
output config console
set verbose False
back
crawl all, !bing_spider, !google_spider, !spider_man
crawl
grep all
grep
audit all
audit
bruteforce all
bruteforce
back
target
set target https://127.0.0.1:3000/
back

start
```

???

Python (2 only)

Couldn't get the GUI running due to way out of date deps

Console works OK though, and easily script-able using examples!

```
[leejohnson@lees-macbook-air J0 C725 14:25:11 master]
/Users/leejohnson/working/w3af > fgrep 'Blind' output-w3af.txt
[Fri Apr 13 14:19:23 2018 - vulnerability] Blind SQL injection was found at:
	"https://127.0.0.1:3000/login", using HTTP method POST. The injectable
	parameter is: "password". This vulnerability was found in the requests
	with ids 19371 and 19382.

[leejohnson@lees-macbook-air J0 C726 14:25:32 master]
/Users/leejohnson/working/w3af > fgrep 19371 !$
[Fri Apr 13 14:19:22 2018 - debug] POST https://127.0.0.1:3000/login with data:

#### [Arachni](http://www.arachni-scanner.com/)

Simple scan:

```
./bin/arachni https://lil_app.com:3000/
```

---

#### [Arachni](http://www.arachni-scanner.com/)

Finds:

<img src="img/arachni.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

???

Ruby

Doesn't support Loopback interfaces (just alias a host to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts)

Didn't find SQL injection points! Maybe it needs more configuration out of the box?

---

#### [Wapty](https://github.com/empijei/wapty)

To install:

```
export GOPATH=/Users/leejohnson/go
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin
go get github.com/empijei/wapty
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/empijei/wapty
make installdeps
make
make install
wapty
```

<img src="img/wapty_1.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

???

Go

I got this running, made sure to follow the instructions and use the proxy

---

#### [Wapty](https://github.com/empijei/wapty)

<img src="img/wapty_2.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

???

But couldn't get it to do anything.

Note there is no target tab?

They do say that it's "not there yet", so one to watch i guess

---

#### [Nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto)

```
[leejohnson@lees-macbook-air J0 C824 15:34:32 master]

Perl

Pretty configurable

Didn't find SQL injection points! Maybe it needs more configuration out of the box?

False positives?
