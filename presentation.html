# Find and Fix Your Web Security Vulnerabilities With Burp Scanner

Lee Johnson (LEEJO / leejo / lee@humanstate.com)

## Should you scan your app for vulnerabilities?

--

* Is it public facing: Yes

--

* Is it internal only: Yes

--

* Is it a single use private app only accessible by you: Why not?

???

---

## How often should you scan?

* Anyone here who has a public facing app that has never been scanned?

???
If so, first thing you do when you get back is set this up!

--

* We get scanned externally once a year

* And self scan at least twice a year

--

* Also scan on any major refactoring or major feature additions

--

* Automating this would be the end goal

???
Haven't got around to doing this yet, and perhaps not so much value as comprehensive scans take a long time (hours)

---

## OWASP (Open Web App Security Project) Top Ten 2017

* Injection

* Broken Authentication

* Sensitive Data Exposure

* XML External Entities (XXE)

* Broken Access Control

* Security Misconfiguration

* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

* Insecure Deserialization

* Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

* Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

???
OWASP Top Ten was updated last year (2017), which was the first update in four years

That's the ten most serious from about one hundred types of attack.

## Finding Vulnerabilities with Burp Scanner

* Burp Suite is a commercial closed sourced product

* Costs about â‚¬300 per single licence

--

* Comprehensive and configurable

* Updated frequently

--

* Industry "standard"

???
When we've been externally scanned it's the one they use

--

* I have no affiliation with them, I just think it's a good product

--

* Open source alternatives are available, more on those later
